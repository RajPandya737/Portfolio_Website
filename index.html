              Hey there, My name is Raj and I am a second year computer engineering
              student at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. I
              have a wide veriety of skills and can fit in almost any role. I
              excel at creating simple solutions to complex problems and always
              love working with new technologies.
            </p>
            <p>
              In my free time I like reading manga, watching sitcoms, and most
              of all, playing chess! I am trying to reach 1500 in bullet so If I
              am online, challenge me to a match

                Anisync is a web application that takes a MyAnimeList username

                Osu! that appear on the user's anime list. As an Osu! player
                myself, I always found it difficult to find maps to play when it
                was so tedious to search one by one. I streamlined the process
                and the project recieved over 1000+ visits in just 3 days
