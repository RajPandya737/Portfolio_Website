    <h1>Hi there, I am Raj</h1>
    <h2>Python Developer based in Ontario, Canada</h2>
    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      I am a 2nd year computer engineering student at McMaster University in
      Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. I have a wide veriety of skills not only in
      python, but in full stack development as well. I excel at creating simple
      solutions to complex problems and always love working with new
      technologies.
    </p>
    <h1>Cool Projects</h1>
    <h2>Anisync</h2>
    <h3>
      Flask, SQLite, Beautiful Soup, API's, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Gunicorn,
      Nginx, Google Analytics, Digital Ocean
    </h3>
    <p>
      Anisync is a web application that takes a MyAnimeList username as input
      and returns a collection of songs from the popular game Osu! that appear
      on the user's anime list. As an Osu! player myself, I always found it
      difficult to find maps to play when it was so tedious to search one by
      one. I streamlined the process and the project recieved over 800 visits in
      just 2 days

    <h2>Rubik's Cube Solver</h2>
    <h3>OpenCV, Numpy, Matplotlib, Pillow, ColorMath</h3>
    <p>
      A program able to solve rubiks cubes by taking photos of each side,
      analysing the colors, and returing the optimal solution to the cube. This
      solution was complimented by a interactive 3-D simulation of the starting
      cube using to give confidence to the user that they have the same cube.
    </p>
    <h2>Number Guesser</h2>
    <h3>TensorFlow, OpenCV, Numpy, Pygame</h3>
    <p>
      Number Guesser allows users to draw digits on a screen using Pygame, and then uses a
      trained neural network (TensorFlow) to guess the drawn digit with up to
      99.8% accuracy.
