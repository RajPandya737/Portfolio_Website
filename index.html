          <p>
            I am a 2nd year computer engineering student at McMaster University
            in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. I have a wide veriety of skills not
            only in python, but in full stack development as well. I excel at
            creating simple solutions to complex problems and always love
            working with new technologies. In my free time, I love reading manga
            and have a deep interest in business. These are some technologies I
            am familiar with:

              <p>
                Anisync is a web application that takes a MyAnimeList username
                as input and returns a collection of songs from the popular game
                Osu! that appear on the user's anime list. As an Osu! player
                myself, I always found it difficult to find maps to play when it
                was so tedious to search one by one. I streamlined the process
                and the project recieved over 800 visits in just 2 days

              <p>
                A program able to solve rubiks cubes by taking photos of each
                side, analysing the colors, and returing the optimal solution to
                the cube. This solution was complimented by a interactive 3-D
                simulation of the starting cube using to give confidence to the
                user that they have the same cube.

                Number Guesser allows users to draw digits on a screen using
                Pygame, and then uses a trained neural network to guess the
                drawn digit with up to 99.8% accuracy.
